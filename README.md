## Aim of the Game

* The aim of this assignment is to design a GeoGame. A geo-game is an interactive game, in 
which a user interacts with the browser has a geo-component and tries to achieve a 
high-score.

## Title of the Game: Find Country

## Features
  - First, the user is asked to select a continent. <br>
  - After the continent is selected, the user is shown a random country name. <br>
  - If the correct country is clicked, the user is notified of the correct answer and is shown the next country name. <br>
  - If the wrong country is clicked, the user is shown the correct country and the score is reduced by a percentage. <br>
  - When all countries have been visited, the game ends and the user is shown the final score. <br>
  - The game can be restarted with the “Restart” button. <br>

## Working Principle
  - The JavaScript file starts with the DOMContentLoaded event. <br>
  - A random country name is selected with the pickNewCountry function. <br>
  - The countryClicked function checks if the clicked country is correct. <br>
  - If the answer is correct, the country counter is incremented. If the answer is incorrect, the score is reduced proportionally out of 100%. <br>
  - At the end of the game, a final score and the possibility to restart is provided. <br>

## JavaScript Library Used
  - Three.js
